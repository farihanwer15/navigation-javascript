            <h1>Protocol Of Introducing People</h1>
            <small>Fariha Anwer</small>
            <p>The basic protocol of introductions calls for introducing the ‘lesser-ranking’ (socially, professionally, by age or seniority) to the ‘higher-ranking’ person. Here are four steps:First, state the name of the person being introduced to. This is the ‘higher-ranking’ person. Second, say “I would like to introduce” or, “please meet” or, “this is,” etc.Third, state the name of the person being introduced. This is the ‘lower-ranking’ person. Finally, offer some details about each, as appropriate. As I wrote in a previous article, add a snippet of information about a topic of common interest between the two parties. Do not elaborate. This will help them connect and pursue a conversation.The foremost principle of etiquette for making introductions lies in understanding reverence and respect. Here are some guidelines.</p>
